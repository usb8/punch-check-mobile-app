## WearBluetoothTestApp
The WearBluetoothTestApp is based on [an example project](https://github.com/android/connectivity-samples/tree/master/BluetoothChat), but you won't be able to send messages from the phone to the watch.
It works together with [this](https://github.com/bauerjj/Android-Simple-Bluetooth-Example/tree/master/app/src/main/java/com/mcuhq/simplebluetooth) application on mobile.
